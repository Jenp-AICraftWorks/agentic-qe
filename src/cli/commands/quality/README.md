# Quality CLI Commands

Five comprehensive quality engineering commands for enterprise-grade quality gates, validation, risk assessment, deployment decisions, and policy management.

## Commands Overview

### 1. `aqe quality gate`
Execute quality gates with configurable thresholds across multiple quality dimensions.

**Features:**
- Code coverage validation
- Cyclomatic complexity checks
- Maintainability index monitoring
- Code duplication detection
- Security hotspot identification
- Bug and vulnerability tracking
- Customizable thresholds per metric

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run with default thresholds
aqe quality gate

# Custom thresholds
aqe quality gate --coverage 90 --complexity 8 --bugs 0

# JSON output for CI/CD
aqe quality gate --json
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: Quality gate passed
- `1`: Quality gate failed

---

### 2. `aqe quality validate`
Validate quality metrics against defined standards using a rule-based system.

**Features:**
- Flexible validation rules (7 default rules)
- Multiple operators (>=, <=, =, !=, >, <)
- Severity levels (error, warning, info)
- Custom rule definitions via JSON
- Detailed validation reporting

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run with default rules
aqe quality validate

# Use custom rules
aqe quality validate --rules ./custom-rules.json

# JSON output
aqe quality validate --json
```

**Rule Format:**
```json
{
  "name": "Code Coverage",
  "metric": "coverage",
  "operator": "gte",
  "threshold": 80,
  "severity": "error"
}
```

### 3. `aqe quality risk`
AI-powered quality risk assessment with probability and impact analysis.

**Features:**
- Multi-category risk analysis (code, testing, security, performance, maintainability)
- Risk scoring (probability × impact)
- Severity classification (critical, high, medium, low)
- Mitigation strategy recommendations
- Trend analysis (improving, stable, degrading)
- Overall risk calculation

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run risk assessment
aqe quality risk

# Detailed analysis
aqe quality risk --detailed

# JSON output
aqe quality risk --json
```

**Risk Categories:**
- **Code Quality**: Complexity, technical debt
- **Testing**: Coverage gaps, flaky tests
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, insecure dependencies
- **Performance**: Bottlenecks, scalability issues
- **Maintainability**: Tech debt, documentation gaps

---

### 4. `aqe quality decision`
Intelligent go/no-go deployment decisions with weighted scoring.

**Features:**
- Multi-factor decision analysis (6 factors)
- Weighted scoring system
- Confidence calculation
- Blocker identification
- Warning detection
- Contextual recommendations
- Three decision states: go, no-go, conditional

**Usage:**
```bash
# Make deployment decision
aqe quality decision

# Custom thresholds
aqe quality decision --coverage-threshold 85 --test-threshold 98

# JSON output
aqe quality decision --json
```

**Decision Factors:**
- Coverage (weight: 25%)
- Test Success (weight: 25%)
- Complexity (weight: 15%)
- Security (weight: 20%)
- Performance (weight: 10%)
- Bugs (weight: 5%)

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: Go or conditional decision
- `1`: No-go decision

---

### 5. `aqe quality policy`
Define and validate quality policies across projects.

**Features:**
- 9 default policy rules
- Category-based organization
- Enforcement modes (strict, advisory)
- Project scope management
- Policy versioning
- Import/export capabilities
- Compliance reporting

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create default policy
aqe quality policy --create

# Load and validate policy
aqe quality policy --load ./quality-policy.json

# Save current policy
aqe quality policy --save ./my-policy.json

# Validate with custom policy
aqe quality policy --load ./custom-policy.json --json
```

**Policy Categories:**
- **Coverage**: Line and branch coverage
- **Testing**: Test success rate
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies
- **Performance**: Response time SLAs
- **Maintainability**: Complexity and tech debt
- **Documentation**: API documentation coverage

**Policy Structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "Enterprise Quality Policy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Standard quality policy",
  "enforcement": "strict",
  "scope": ["*"],
  "rules": [...]
}
```

## Integration with Claude Flow

All quality commands integrate with Claude Flow's memory system for coordination:

```bash
# Commands automatically store results in memory
# Memory keys:
# - aqe/swarm/quality-cli-commands/gate-result
# - aqe/swarm/quality-cli-commands/validate-result
# - aqe/swarm/quality-cli-commands/risk-result
# - aqe/swarm/quality-cli-commands/decision-result
# - aqe/swarm/quality-cli-commands/policy-result
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
- name: Quality Gate
  run: aqe quality gate --json > quality-gate.json

- name: Risk Assessment
  run: aqe quality risk --json > risk-report.json

- name: Deployment Decision
  run: aqe quality decision
  # Automatically fails pipeline if decision is "no-go"
```

### GitLab CI Example
```yaml
quality_check:
  script:
    - aqe quality gate
    - aqe quality validate
    - aqe quality decision
  artifacts:
    reports:
      quality: quality-*.json
```

---

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite with 27+ tests:

```bash
# Run all quality command tests
npm test tests/cli/quality.test.ts

# Run specific test suite

## Best Practices

1. **Set Realistic Thresholds**: Start with achievable thresholds and gradually increase
2. **Automate in CI/CD**: Integrate quality commands into your pipeline
3. **Use JSON Output**: Parse results programmatically for dashboards
4. **Create Custom Policies**: Define organization-specific quality standards
5. **Monitor Trends**: Track quality metrics over time
6. **Address Blockers First**: Prioritize critical issues before warnings
7. **Share Policies**: Use version-controlled policy files across projects

## Coordination with Agent 2

Quality CLI commands coordinate with Agent 2's MCP tools:

**Shared Memory Keys:**
- `aqe/swarm/quality-cli-commands/metrics` - Current quality metrics
- `aqe/swarm/quality-cli-commands/progress` - Implementation progress
- `aqe/swarm/quality-gate/*` - Quality gate results
- `aqe/swarm/quality-validate/*` - Validation results

**MCP Tool Integration:**
- CLI commands collect metrics
- MCP tools orchestrate quality workflows
- Shared memory enables cross-agent coordination

---

## Examples

### Basic Quality Workflow
```bash
# 1. Execute quality gate
aqe quality gate

# 2. Validate against standards
aqe quality validate

# 3. Assess risks
aqe quality risk

# 4. Make deployment decision
aqe quality decision

# 5. Validate policy compliance
aqe quality policy
```

### Advanced CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Run all quality checks
aqe quality gate --json > quality-gate.json
aqe quality validate --json > validation.json
aqe quality risk --json > risk-assessment.json

# Make deployment decision
if aqe quality decision --json > decision.json; then
  echo "✓ Quality checks passed - proceeding with deployment"
  exit 0
else
  echo "✗ Quality checks failed - blocking deployment"
  exit 1
fi
```
