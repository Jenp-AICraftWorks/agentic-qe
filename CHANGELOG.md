## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-07

### Fixed

#### Test Infrastructure
- Fixed agent lifecycle synchronization issues in unit tests
- Resolved async timing problems in test execution
- Corrected status management in agent state machine
- Fixed task rejection handling with proper error propagation
- Improved metrics tracking timing accuracy

#### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Removed vulnerable `faker` package (CVE-2022-42003)
- Upgraded to `@faker-js/faker@^10.0.0` for secure fake data generation
- Updated all imports to use new faker package
- Verified zero high-severity vulnerabilities with `npm audit`

#### Memory Management
- Enhanced garbage collection in test execution
- Optimized memory usage in parallel test workers
- Fixed memory leaks in long-running agent processes
- Added memory monitoring and cleanup mechanisms

### Added

#### Documentation
- Created comprehensive USER-GUIDE.md with workflows and examples
- Added CONFIGURATION.md with complete configuration reference
- Created TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common issues and solutions
- Updated README.md with v1.0.1 changes
- Added missing documentation files identified in assessment

### Changed

#### Test Configuration
- Updated Jest configuration for better memory management
- Improved test isolation with proper cleanup
- Enhanced test execution reliability
- Optimized worker configuration for CI/CD environments

#### Dependencies
- Removed deprecated `faker` package
- Added `@faker-js/faker@^10.0.0`
- Updated test dependencies for security compliance

### Breaking Changes

None. This is a patch release with backward-compatible fixes.

### Migration Guide

If you were using the old `faker` package in custom tests:

```typescript
// Before (v1.0.0)
import faker from 'faker';
const name = faker.name.findName();

// After (v1.0.1)
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
const name = faker.person.fullName();  // API changed
```

### Known Issues

- Coverage baseline establishment in progress (blocked by test fixes in v1.0.0)
- Some integration tests may require environment-specific configuration
- Performance benchmarks pending validation
