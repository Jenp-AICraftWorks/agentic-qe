## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Existing Users (v1.0.5 ‚Üí v1.1.0)

**Good news: All Phase 2 features are opt-in and fully backward compatible!**

#### 1. Install the update
```bash
npm install agentic-qe@1.1.0
```

#### 2. Initialize Phase 2 features (optional)
```bash
aqe init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 10
```

This will:
- Initialize learning databases
- Set up pattern bank
- Configure improvement loop
- Create agent definitions

#### 3. Enable learning for agents (optional)
```typescript
// In your agent configuration
{
  enableLearning: true,  // Enable learning
  enablePatterns: true,  // Enable pattern reuse
  learningRate: 0.1      // Default learning rate
}
```

#### 4. Start using new features
```bash
# Check learning status
aqe learn status

# Extract patterns from existing tests
aqe patterns extract --path ./tests

# Analyze for flaky tests
aqe agent execute --name qe-flaky-test-hunter --task "Analyze test suite"

# Run improvement cycle
aqe improve cycle
```

### If You're Not Ready for Phase 2
**No action needed!** All Phase 2 features are disabled by default. Your existing workflows continue to work exactly as before.
