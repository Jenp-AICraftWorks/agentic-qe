### Migration Notes

**If using faker in custom tests:**

```typescript
// Before (v1.0.0) - DON'T USE
import faker from 'faker';
const name = faker.name.findName();

import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
const name = faker.person.fullName();  // API changed slightly
```

**Most users:** No changes required. The package handles migration internally.
