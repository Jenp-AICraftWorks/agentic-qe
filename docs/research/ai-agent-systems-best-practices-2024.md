## Conclusion

Modern AI agent systems require careful engineering of three core pillars:

1. **Orchestration:** Choose patterns based on task characteristics (sequential, parallel, hierarchical)
2. **Memory:** Implement robust shared state management to prevent coordination failures
3. **Specialization:** Create focused agents with clear responsibilities and tool access

The research reveals that **token usage and memory management** are the primary determinants of multi-agent system performance. Organizations implementing these patterns report **2-4x performance improvements**, **40-50% cost reductions**, and **10+ week time savings** per team.

**Key Takeaway:** Success in multi-agent systems comes from treating memory as a first-class architectural concern, not an afterthought.
