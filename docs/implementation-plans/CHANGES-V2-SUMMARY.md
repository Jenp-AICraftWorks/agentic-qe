## Major Changes

### 1. Sprint Structure

#### V1.0 Plan (OLD):
```
Sprint 1: Test Infrastructure (40h)

**Note:** Sprint 3 is OPTIONAL and should be evaluated after v1.1.0 production deployment.

### 4. Excluded Enhancements

As per user requirement, the following were **excluded** from the plans:

- ❌ New agent definitions (user already has 17 QE agents + templates)

1. **Approve v2.0 plan** with stakeholders
2. **Begin DEPLOY-001** (Jest environment fix)
   - Highest priority, blocks 86.8% of failures
   - Simple fix with high impact
3. **Execute Sprint 1 critical path** (8-10 hours)
4. **Monitor progress** with daily standups

### Post-Production Actions (Week 4+)

1. **Evaluate Sprint 3 ROI** after v1.1.0 deployment
2. **Prioritize features** by ROI:
   - Multi-Model Router: $61,000/year (highest)
   - Agent Booster WASM: $48,000/year
   - QUIC Transport: $10,800/year

## Conclusion

The v2.0 implementation plan represents a **significant simplification** based on the discovery that Sprint 2 Memory System is already complete. This results in:

✅ **34% cost reduction** ($39,600 saved)
✅ **2 weeks faster to production**
✅ **Lower complexity and risk**
✅ **Clearer focus on critical path**

The revised plan maintains all valuable improvements while eliminating unnecessary work, resulting in a more efficient path to production readiness.
