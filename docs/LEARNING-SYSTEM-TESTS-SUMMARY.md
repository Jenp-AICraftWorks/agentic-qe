## Technical Approach

### TDD London/Chicago Schools
- **London (Mock-based):** Component isolation for unit behavior
- **Chicago (Integration):** Real collaboration for system validation

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Learning System Integration Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Initialize fresh instances
    memoryManager = new SwarmMemoryManager();
    performanceTracker = new PerformanceTracker();
    learningEngine = new LearningEngine();
    improvementLoop = new ImprovementLoop();
  });

  it('should complete full learning flow', async () => {
    // 1. Record baseline
    // 2. Execute & learn
    // 3. Record improved
    // 4. Verify improvement
  });
});
```

   export const Logger = {
     getInstance: () => ({
       info: jest.fn(),
       warn: jest.fn(),
       error: jest.fn(),
       debug: jest.fn()
     })
   };
   ```

2. **Run integration tests**
   ```bash
   npm test tests/integration/learning-system.test.ts
   ```
