### ML Flaky Detection
- Requires historical test data for best results (minimum 10 runs)
- Some flakiness types harder to detect (environmental factors)
- Model retraining needed periodically for optimal accuracy

### Improvement Loop
- A/B testing requires sufficient sample size (minimum 30 per variant)
