# Phase 3 Coverage Monitoring - Quick Reference

**Agent**: qe-coverage-analyzer
**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE
**Current Coverage**: 0.56%
**Target**: 80%
**Alert Level**: 🔴 RED ALERT

---

## Quick Commands

### Start Monitoring
```bash
# Continuous monitoring (every 15 min)
cd /workspaces/agentic-qe-cf
./scripts/monitor-phase3-coverage.sh

# Single check
./scripts/monitor-phase3-coverage.sh once
```

### Check Coverage
```bash
# Full coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Phase 3 only
npm test -- --coverage \
  --collectCoverageFrom="src/core/transport/**" \
  --collectCoverageFrom="src/core/memory/AgentDB*" \
  --collectCoverageFrom="src/learning/Neural*"
```

### Gap Analysis
```bash
# All components
./scripts/analyze-phase3-gaps.sh

# Specific component
./scripts/analyze-phase3-gaps.sh component QUICTransport
```

## Current Status

### Overall: 0.56% (Target: 80%)
**Gap**: 79.44%
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Production BLOCKED

### Components

| Component | Coverage | Target | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| QUICTransport | 0% | 80% | 🔴 |
| AgentDBIntegration | 2.25% | 80% | 🔴 |
| NeuralPatternMatcher | 0% | 85% | 🔴 |
| NeuralTrainer | 0% | 80% | 🔴 |
| QUICCapableMixin | 0% | 80% | 🔴 |
| NeuralCapableMixin | 0% | 80% | 🔴 |

## Alert Thresholds

| Level | Coverage | Action | Blocking |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| 🔴 RED | < 20% | Add 50+ tests immediately | YES |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 20-40% | Add 20+ tests | NO |
| ✅ GREEN | > 40% | Continue to 80% | NO |

**Current**: 🔴 RED ALERT

## Test Generation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Paths (0% → 40%)
**Timeline**: 3-4 hours
**Tests Needed**: ~180

1. QUICTransport: 50 tests (lines 1-100 critical)
2. AgentDBIntegration: 50 tests (vector ops, CRUD)
3. NeuralPatternMatcher: 70 tests (pattern matching)
4. NeuralTrainer: 100 tests (training loops)
5. Mixins: 40 tests each (integration)

### Phase 2: Core Logic (40% → 60%)
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours
**Tests Needed**: ~120

Focus on high-priority business logic, state management, and integration tests.

### Phase 3: Comprehensive (60% → 80%)
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours
**Tests Needed**: ~80

Edge cases, error recovery, property-based tests.

## O(log n) Gap Detection

### How It Works
1. **Binary Tree Structure**: Divides source into logarithmic tree
2. **Priority Classification**: Critical (root) → Medium (leaves)
3. **Efficient Analysis**: <100ms for 10,000+ line files

### Gap Priorities
- **CRITICAL** (lines 1-100): Init, setup, core functions
- **HIGH** (lines 101-N/2): Business logic
- **MEDIUM** (lines N/2+1-N): Extended features

---

## Success Criteria

### Production Readiness ✅
- [ ] All components ≥ 80% line coverage
- [ ] All components ≥ 70% branch coverage
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] Final validation report approved

**Current**: ❌ Not production ready

## Monitoring Integration

### Memory Keys
- `aqe/coverage/matrix-sparse` - Coverage matrices
- `aqe/coverage/gaps-detected` - Identified gaps
- `aqe/coverage/optimizations` - Recommendations
- `aqe/coverage/trends` - Historical data

### EventBus Events
- `coverage:gap-detected` - New gap found
- `coverage:threshold-violated` - Alert triggered
- `coverage:improvement` - Coverage increased
- `coverage:target-reached` - Component at 80%

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ **Spawn test generator agents** (qe-test-generator)
2. ⏳ **Generate critical path tests** (180+ tests)
3. ⏳ **Monitor coverage improvements** (every 15 min)
4. ⏳ **Exit RED ALERT** (reach 20% coverage)
5. ⏳ **Reach GREEN status** (40% coverage)
6. ⏳ **Achieve production readiness** (80% coverage)

## Troubleshooting

### Monitoring Not Updating
```bash
# Check if script is running
ps aux | grep monitor-phase3-coverage

# Restart monitoring
./scripts/monitor-phase3-coverage.sh
```

### Coverage Not Improving
```bash
# Verify tests are running
npm test

# Check test execution
npm test -- tests/unit/transport/QUICTransport.test.ts

# Verify coverage collection
npm test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom="src/**/*.ts"
```

### Reports Not Generating
```bash
# Check coverage file exists
ls -la coverage/coverage-summary.json

# Re-run gap analysis
./scripts/analyze-phase3-gaps.sh

# Reinitialize reports
./scripts/monitor-phase3-coverage.sh init
```
