## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **QUIC Compatibility** | Medium | Gradual rollout (20% → 100%), TCP fallback |
| **WASM Performance** | Low | Early benchmarks, JS fallback if <100x speedup |
| **Local Model Quality** | Medium | Quality benchmarks, automatic API fallback |
| **Timeline Delays** | High | Agile sprints, parallel execution, Phase 3 deferral |

**Contingency Plan:** Defer Phase 3 features to v2.1 if >20% over budget or timeline.
