## 📞 Emergency Contacts

**If Costs Spike:**
1. Check cost dashboard
2. Verify budget alerts working
3. Disable router: `ENABLE_MULTI_MODEL_ROUTER=false`
4. Restart with single model

**If Quality Drops:**
1. Check quality metrics
2. Increase complexity thresholds
3. Use higher-tier models
4. Rollback if <90%

**If Performance Degrades:**
1. Check QUIC fallback to HTTP/2
2. Verify WASM compilation
3. Monitor p95 latency
4. Scale back if needed
