**Fix Pattern**:
```typescript
// Current (FAILS)
(Logger.getInstance as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue(mockLogger);

// Fixed (WORKS)
jest.mock('../utils/Logger', () => ({
  Logger: {
    getInstance: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
      info: jest.fn(),
      error: jest.fn(),
      debug: jest.fn(),
      warn: jest.fn()
    })
