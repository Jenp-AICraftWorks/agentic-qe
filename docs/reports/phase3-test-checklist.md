  --collectCoverageFrom="src/core/transport/QUICTransport.ts"

# Check if targets met
npm test -- --coverage --coverageThreshold='{
  "global": {
    "branches": 80,

    "lines": 80,
    "statements": 80
  }
}'

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Starting Week 1 (Monday Morning)

```bash
# 1. Create AgentDB test file
touch tests/unit/memory/AgentDBIntegration.test.ts

# 2. Copy test template
cat > tests/unit/memory/AgentDBIntegration.test.ts << 'EOF'
/**
 * AgentDB Integration Unit Tests
 * Coverage target: 80%+
 */

import { QUICTransportWrapper, AgentDBIntegration } from '../../../src/core/memory/AgentDBIntegration';

describe('AgentDBIntegration', () => {
  describe('QUICTransportWrapper', () => {
    describe('Initialization', () => {
      it('should initialize transport with valid config', () => {
        // TODO: Implement
      });
    });
  });
});
EOF

# 3. Run initial test (should have 0 tests)
npm test tests/unit/memory/AgentDBIntegration.test.ts

# 4. Start implementing tests from checklist above
```
