{
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "qe-test-generator",
      "type": "qe-test-generator",
      "status": "active",
      "capabilities": ["test-generation", "sublinear-optimization"]
    },
    {
      "id": "qe-coverage-analyzer",
      "type": "qe-coverage-analyzer",
      "status": "active",
      "capabilities": ["coverage-analysis", "gap-detection"]
    }
    // ... add all 18 QE agents
