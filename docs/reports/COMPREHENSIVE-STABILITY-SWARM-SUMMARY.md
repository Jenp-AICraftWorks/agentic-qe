## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Parallel Agent Execution** - 5 agents working simultaneously
2. **SwarmMemoryManager Integration** - Seamless coordination
3. **Strategic Analysis First** - Pass rate accelerator provided clear roadmap
4. **Real Database Testing** - Integration tests caught real issues
5. **Comprehensive Documentation** - 14 reports for full transparency

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Implementation Planning** - Should identify missing classes before creating tests
2. **Coverage Strategy** - TDD approach works better when implementations exist
3. **Time Estimation** - Coverage expansion blocked by 8-12 hour implementation gap

### Best Practices Established
1. **Systematic Fixing** - Category-based approach (ROI-driven)
2. **Database Coordination** - All agents use SwarmMemoryManager
3. **Real Integration Testing** - No mocks in integration tests
4. **Continuous Monitoring** - Orchestrator provides real-time visibility
5. **Strategic Planning** - Analysis before execution
