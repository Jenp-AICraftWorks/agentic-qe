## 📞 Questions & Concerns

**Q: Why not include memory system in v1.0.1?**
A: Too large for patch release (4 weeks effort), high risk of introducing bugs, better to stabilize first.

**Q: When can we start using advanced features?**
A: v1.1.0 (6-8 weeks) for coordination patterns, v1.2.0+ (3-6 months) for neural/distributed.

**Q: What if test fixes take longer?**
A: Timeline extends proportionally, but quality cannot be compromised. Daily progress reviews.

**Q: Can we skip v1.0.1 and go straight to v1.1.0?**
A: Not recommended. Security vulnerability is critical, and users expect patch releases for stability.

**Q: What about breaking changes?**
A: Avoid in v1.0.1 (patch). Acceptable in v1.1.0 (minor) with migration guide. Plan carefully for v2.0.0 (major).
