### Example: code-review-quality

```typescript
// Automated Code Review
const reviewAnalysis = await agent.reviewCode({
  files: prChanges,
  depth: 'comprehensive',
  checkBugs: true,
  checkSecurity: true
});

// Fleet Coordination
const reviewFleet = await FleetManager.coordinate({
  strategy: 'code-review',
  agents: ['qe-quality-analyzer', 'qe-security-scanner', 'qe-performance-tester'],
  topology: 'parallel'
});
```

- **Execution Mode**: Parallel (single coordinated swarm)
- **Success Rate**: 100% (13/13 agents completed)
- **Files Modified**: 17 skill files
- **Total Additions**: ~3,500 lines of enhanced content
- **Execution Time**: ~5 minutes (vs. ~2-3 hours sequential)

### Efficiency Gains
