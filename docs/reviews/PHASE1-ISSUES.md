### Issue #5: Feature Flags Not Implemented
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Priority:** P1
**Component:** Core/Configuration
**Assignee:** TBD
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

**Description:**
Feature flags for gradual rollout of Phase 1 features have not been implemented in FleetConfig.

**Expected Changes:**
```typescript
interface FleetConfig {
  features?: {
    multiModelRouter?: boolean;  // Default: false
    streaming?: boolean;          // Default: false
  };
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Feature flags in FleetConfig
