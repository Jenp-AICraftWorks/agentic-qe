# TypeScript Compilation Fix (Release 1.2.0)

## Problem

**Blocker**: `npm run build` and `npm pack` were failing due to TypeScript compilation errors.

## Error Details

```
src/agents/TestExecutorAgent.ts(652,11): error TS2552: Cannot find name '_valueIndex'. Did you mean 'valueIndex'?
```

## Root Cause

In `TestExecutorAgent.ts` line 652, the code was incrementing `_valueIndex` (with underscore prefix) instead of the declared variable `valueIndex`.

This was a simple typo where:
- Line 644 declared: `let valueIndex = 0;`
- Line 652 incorrectly used: `_valueIndex++;`

## Fix Applied

**File**: `/workspaces/agentic-qe-cf/src/agents/TestExecutorAgent.ts`

**Changed line 652**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
_valueIndex++;

// AFTER (correct)
valueIndex++;
```

## Context

The variable is used to track the number of non-zero dependency weights added to the sparse matrix during test execution order optimization. The typo prevented the counter from incrementing, though it didn't affect the sparse matrix construction itself (only the unused counter).

## Verification

```bash
# TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit
# ✅ Returns 0 errors

# Build verification
npm run build
# ✅ Completes successfully

# Package creation
npm pack --dry-run
# ✅ Creates package successfully
```

## Impact

- **Before**: Build and package creation failed
- **After**: Clean compilation, successful build and packaging
- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Side Effects**: None (the counter wasn't being used in logic)

## Related Issues

This fixes P0 blocker for Release 1.2.0 preventing npm package publication.

## Testing

No additional tests required - this is a compilation fix for existing functionality.
