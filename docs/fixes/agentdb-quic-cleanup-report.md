# AgentDB/QUIC Test Cleanup Report

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Agent**: Test Cleanup Specialist
**Status**: âœ… Completed

## Summary

Removed 3 test files that tested Phase 3 AgentDB/QUIC features which were intentionally removed during the AgentDB migration. These tests referenced non-existent source code.

## Files Deleted

1. **`tests/unit/core/memory/AgentDBIntegration.test.ts`** (1,055 lines)
   - Tested deleted `src/core/memory/AgentDBIntegration.ts` (2,290 lines)
   - Comprehensive integration tests for AgentDB CRUD operations
   - Vector search and QUIC sync test coverage

2. **`tests/unit/core/memory/AgentDBManager.test.ts`** (435 lines)
   - Unit tests for AgentDB manager functionality
   - Memory operations and configuration tests

3. **`tests/unit/core/memory/SwarmMemoryManager.quic.test.ts`** (405 lines)
   - QUIC transport and synchronization tests
   - Swarm memory coordination via QUIC protocol

**Total Lines Removed**: 1,895 lines of test code

## Rationale

During Phase 3 AgentDB migration, the core AgentDB integration implementation (`src/core/memory/AgentDBIntegration.ts`) was removed as the team decided against including AgentDB/QUIC features in the v1.2.0 release. These test files were importing from the deleted implementation file, causing compilation failures.

## Impact on Test Suite

- **Before**: 3 failing test files due to missing imports
- **After**: Clean test suite, no phantom tests
- **Test Coverage**: No impact on actual codebase coverage (tested deleted code)
- **CI/CD**: Build and test pipeline now passes without import errors

## Verification

```bash
$ ls -la tests/unit/core/memory/
total 0
drwx------ 2 vscode vscode  64 Oct 21 17:35 .
drwx------ 5 vscode vscode 160 Oct 20 15:45 ..
```

Directory is now empty - all AgentDB/QUIC tests successfully removed.

## Related Changes

This cleanup is part of the broader Phase 3 AgentDB migration where the following were removed:
- `src/core/memory/AgentDBIntegration.ts` (2,290 lines)
- `src/learning/NeuralTrainer.ts`
- `src/learning/NeuralPatternMatcher.ts`
- QUIC transport implementations
- Certificate validators

## Next Steps

No further action required. Test suite is clean and ready for v1.2.0 release.
