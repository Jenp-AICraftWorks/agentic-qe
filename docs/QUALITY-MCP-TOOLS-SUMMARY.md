## ðŸ“ˆ Implementation Statistics

- **Total Lines of Code:** 3,263 lines
- **Total Test Cases:** 27+
- **Test Assertions:** 189+
- **Handlers Created:** 5
- **Files Created:** 6
- **Integration Points:** Claude Flow hooks, Agent Registry, Memory Store

## ðŸ”„ Claude Flow Integration

All handlers integrate with Claude Flow coordination:

### Pre-Task Hook
```typescript
await this.hookExecutor.executePreTask({
  description: 'Task description',
  agentType: 'quality-gate',
  agentId,
  sessionId: requestId
});
```

### Post-Edit Hook (Memory Storage)
```typescript
await this.hookExecutor.executePostEdit({
  file: `quality-gate-${requestId}`,
  memoryKey: `aqe/swarm/quality-mcp-tools/executions/${requestId}`
});
```

### Post-Task Hook
```typescript
await this.hookExecutor.executePostTask({
  taskId: requestId,
  agentType: 'quality-gate',
  agentId,
  sessionId: requestId,
  results: { ... }
});
```

### Notify Hook
```typescript
await this.hookExecutor.notify({
  message: 'Status update',
  level: 'info'
});
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Swarm Coordination

**Shared Memory Keys:**
- `aqe/swarm/quality-mcp-tools/progress` - Task progress tracking
- `aqe/swarm/quality-mcp-tools/complete` - Completion status
- `aqe/swarm/quality-mcp-tools/executions/{id}` - Gate executions
- `aqe/swarm/quality-mcp-tools/validations/{id}` - Metric validations
- `aqe/swarm/quality-mcp-tools/risk-assessments/{id}` - Risk assessments
- `aqe/swarm/quality-mcp-tools/decisions/{id}` - Deployment decisions
- `aqe/swarm/quality-mcp-tools/policy-checks/{id}` - Policy checks

**Coordination with Other Agents:**
- Agent 8 (Quality CLI Commands) - Shared metrics and results via memory
- Agent 3 (Coverage Tools) - Risk and quality data exchange

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Examples

### 1. Execute Quality Gate
```typescript
const handler = new QualityGateExecuteHandler(registry, hookExecutor);
const result = await handler.handle({
  projectId: 'my-project',
  buildId: 'build-123',
  environment: 'production',
  metrics: { /* quality metrics */ }
});
```

### 2. Validate Metrics
```typescript
const handler = new QualityValidateMetricsHandler(hookExecutor);
const result = await handler.handle({
  metrics: { /* metrics */ },
  thresholds: { /* custom thresholds */ },
  strictMode: true
});
```

### 3. Assess Risk
```typescript
const handler = new QualityRiskAssessHandler(hookExecutor);
const result = await handler.handle({
  context: { projectId, environment, criticality },
  metrics: { /* comprehensive metrics */ },
  aiReasoning: true
});
```

### 4. Make Decision
```typescript
const handler = new QualityDecisionMakeHandler(hookExecutor);
const result = await handler.handle({
  context: { /* deployment context */ },
  inputs: {
    qualityGateResult,
    riskAssessment,
    policyCompliance
  }
});
```

### 5. Check Policy
```typescript
const handler = new QualityPolicyCheckHandler(hookExecutor);
const result = await handler.handle({
  policyId: 'iso-25010', // or custom policy
  metrics: { /* metrics */ }
});
```

## ðŸš€ Key Features

1. **TDD Implementation** - All handlers created with tests
2. **Claude Flow Integration** - Full hook coordination support
3. **Memory Sharing** - Results stored for swarm coordination
4. **AI-Powered** - Psycho-symbolic reasoning for complex scenarios
5. **Policy-Based** - Flexible policy enforcement
