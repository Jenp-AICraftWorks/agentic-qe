     ‚îî‚îÄ> Risk: HIGH | Impact: HIGH | Complexity: 4

  3. src/utils/validators.ts:78-85
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Email validation - 8 uncovered lines
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Risk: MEDIUM | Impact: HIGH | Complexity: 2

HIGH (5):
  4. src/api/users.ts:102-115 (error handling)
  5. src/services/notification.ts:45-58 (retry logic)
  ...

üí° Recommendations:
   1. Generate 5 tests for authentication flow
   2. Add boundary tests for payment validation
   3. Improve error handling coverage

‚úÖ Found 12 gaps (3 critical, 5 high priority)
```

### Gap Analysis with Threshold

```bash
aqe analyze gaps --threshold 98
```

Finds gaps preventing you from reaching 98% coverage.

### Gap Analysis for Specific Path

```bash
aqe analyze gaps --path src/services
```

Analyzes only the `src/services` directory.

## Priority Ranking

### How Gaps Are Prioritized

AQE ranks gaps using multiple factors:

1. **Risk Level** - How likely is this code path to have bugs?
   - Critical: Authentication, payment, security
   - High: Data validation, error handling
   - Medium: Business logic
   - Low: Logging, formatting

2. **Impact** - What happens if this code fails?
   - High: Data loss, security breach, system crash
   - Medium: Feature degradation
   - Low: Cosmetic issues

3. **Complexity** - How complex is the uncovered code?
   - Based on cyclomatic complexity
   - Higher complexity = higher priority

4. **Change Frequency** - How often is this code modified?
   - Frequently changed code needs better tests

**Priority Formula:**
```
Priority = (Risk √ó 3) + (Impact √ó 2) + (Complexity √ó 1)
```

## Trend Analysis

### Analyze Coverage Trends

```bash
aqe analyze trends
```

**Output:**

     ‚îî‚îÄ> Coverage: 85%
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Risk: Invalid data acceptance
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Recommendation: Add property-based tests

MEDIUM RISK AREAS (8):
  4. src/api/users.ts (88% coverage)
  5. src/services/notification.ts (89% coverage)
  ...

üí° Recommendations:
   - Focus on high-risk areas first
   - Improve coverage to 95% to reduce risk score to 20/100
   - Add security and integration tests for critical paths
```

### Generate Risk Report

```bash
aqe analyze risk --format html --output risk-report.html
```

Creates comprehensive risk assessment report.

## Sublinear Algorithms

### Why O(log n) Matters

**Traditional Coverage Analysis:**
- Time: O(n) - linear with codebase size
- 10K LOC: ~30 seconds
- 100K LOC: ~5 minutes
- 1M LOC: ~50 minutes

**AQE Sublinear Analysis:**
- Time: O(log n) - logarithmic
- 10K LOC: ~0.5 seconds
- 100K LOC: ~5 seconds
- 1M LOC: ~30 seconds

**300x faster on large codebases!**

### Enable/Disable Sublinear

```bash
# Enabled by default (recommended)
aqe analyze coverage --sublinear

# Disable for debugging
aqe analyze coverage --no-sublinear
```

### How It Works

AQE uses:
1. **Sparse matrix representation** - Only stores covered/uncovered regions
2. **Binary search** - Finds gaps in O(log n) time
3. **Sampling** - Analyzes representative code sections
4. **Caching** - Reuses analysis for unchanged files

## Quality Analysis

### Analyze Test Quality

```bash
aqe analyze quality --path tests/
```

**Output:**
```
üìä Test Quality Analysis:

Overall Score: 78/100 (Good)

Metrics:
  ‚úì Coverage: 93.5% (Excellent)
  ‚ö† Flakiness: 3 flaky tests detected (Fair)
  ‚úì Reliability: 98.3% pass rate (Excellent)
  ‚ö† Execution time: 45s (Fair, target: <30s)

Flaky Tests (3):
  1. tests/integration/payment.test.ts:45
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Flakiness: 15% (passes 85% of time)
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Recommendation: Add explicit waits

  2. tests/e2e/checkout.test.ts:120
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Flakiness: 8% (timing issues)
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Recommendation: Stabilize test data

Issues Detected:
  - 5 tests with no assertions
  - 12 tests exceeding 10s execution time
  - 3 tests with random failures

üí° Recommendations:
   1. Fix or remove 3 flaky tests
   2. Add assertions to 5 tests
   3. Optimize 12 slow tests
```

## Practical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Achieve 95% Coverage

**Step 1: Check current coverage**
```bash
aqe analyze coverage
# Current: 88.5%
```

**Step 2: Find gaps**
```bash
aqe analyze gaps --threshold 95
# Shows gaps preventing 95% coverage
```

**Step 3: Generate tests for gaps**
```bash
# Generate tests for top 3 critical gaps
aqe generate src/services/auth.ts --coverage 95
aqe generate src/services/payment.ts --coverage 95
aqe generate src/utils/validators.ts --coverage 95
```

**Step 4: Run tests and verify**
```bash
aqe run --coverage
aqe analyze coverage
# Current: 95.2% ‚úÖ
```

### Workflow 2: Monitor Coverage in CI/CD

**Step 1: Collect baseline**
```bash
# After merging to main
aqe run --coverage
aqe analyze coverage --format json --output coverage-baseline.json
```

**Step 2: Check in CI**
```bash
# In CI pipeline
aqe run --coverage
aqe analyze coverage --baseline coverage-baseline.json --diff

# Fail if coverage decreased
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Coverage decreased!"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Step 3: Update baseline**
```bash
# After successful merge
cp coverage-current.json coverage-baseline.json
```

### Workflow 3: Improve Coverage Over Time

**Week 1: Establish baseline**
```bash
aqe analyze coverage
# Current: 80%
```

**Week 2: Focus on critical gaps**
```bash
aqe analyze gaps
# Generate tests for critical gaps
aqe generate <critical-files>
# New coverage: 85%
```

**Week 3: Address high-priority gaps**
```bash
aqe analyze gaps --threshold 90
aqe generate <high-priority-files>
# New coverage: 90%
```

**Week 4: Reach target**
```bash
aqe analyze gaps --threshold 95
aqe generate <remaining-gaps>
# New coverage: 95% ‚úÖ
```

## Output Formats

## Troubleshooting

### No Coverage Data

**Problem:** Coverage shows 0% or not found

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Run tests with coverage first
aqe run --coverage

# Check coverage files generated
ls coverage/

# Re-analyze
aqe analyze coverage
```

### Coverage Below Threshold

**Problem:** Coverage below 95% threshold

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Find gaps
aqe analyze gaps --threshold 95

# Generate tests for gaps
aqe generate <files-with-gaps>

# Verify improvement
aqe run --coverage
aqe analyze coverage
```

### Analysis Too Slow

**Problem:** Analysis takes too long

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ensure sublinear algorithms enabled (default)
aqe analyze coverage --sublinear

# Analyze specific path
aqe analyze coverage --path src/services

# Check for large node_modules coverage (exclude in config)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Set realistic thresholds** - 95% is excellent, 100% is often unnecessary
2. **Focus on critical code** - Authentication, payments, data handling
3. **Monitor trends** - Track coverage over time, not just absolute numbers
4. **Use risk assessment** - Prioritize high-risk gaps
5. **Integrate with CI/CD** - Fail builds if coverage decreases
6. **Review regularly** - Weekly coverage reviews help maintain quality
