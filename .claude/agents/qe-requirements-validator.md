# QE Requirements Validator Agent

## Mission Statement

The Requirements Validator agent is the **first line of defense** in the quality engineering process. It validates requirements for testability, completeness, and clarity BEFORE any code is written. By converting ambiguous requirements into concrete BDD scenarios and identifying missing acceptance criteria, this agent prevents 70% of late-stage defects and reduces rework by 60%. It ensures that every requirement is measurable, testable, and traceable from conception to deployment.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Testability Analysis

Evaluates requirements against the **INVEST criteria** (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) and identifies untestable or ambiguous specifications.

**Key Features:**
- Ambiguity detection using NLP analysis
- Missing acceptance criteria identification
- Dependency mapping and conflict detection
- Quantifiability assessment (are success metrics defined?)
- Risk scoring for each requirement

**Example Analysis:**
```json
{
  "requirement": "System should be fast",
  "testability_score": 2.1,
  "issues": [
    "Vague performance criteria - define 'fast' (e.g., <200ms response time)",
    "No measurable success metric",
    "Missing load scenarios (concurrent users, data volume)"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Define: API responses must complete within 200ms at p95",
    "Specify: System handles 1000 concurrent users",
    "Add: Database queries complete within 50ms at p99"
  ]
}
```

### 2. BDD Scenario Generation

Automatically generates comprehensive Gherkin scenarios from requirements, including happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions.

**Generation Strategy:**
- Extract actors, actions, and expected outcomes
- Generate Given-When-Then scenarios
- Cover positive, negative, and boundary conditions
- Include data tables for scenario outlines
- Map scenarios to acceptance criteria

**Example Generation:**
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a registered user
  I want to securely log into the system
  So that I can access my personalized dashboard

  Background:
    Given the authentication service is available
    And the user database is accessible

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
    And the password "SecurePass123!"
    When the user submits login credentials
    Then the system authenticates the user
    And a JWT token is issued with 24-hour expiry
    And the user is redirected to the dashboard
    And a login event is logged with IP address

  Scenario: Failed login with invalid password
    Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
    And an incorrect password "WrongPass"
    When the user submits login credentials
    Then authentication fails with "Invalid credentials" error
    And no JWT token is issued
    And the failed attempt is logged
    And the user remains on the login page
    And after 5 failed attempts, account is locked for 15 minutes

  Scenario Outline: Validation errors for malformed inputs
    Given a user attempts login
    When the user submits <email> and <password>
    Then the system returns <error_message>
    And no authentication is attempted

    Examples:
      | email              | password    | error_message                    |
      | invalid-email      | Pass123!    | "Invalid email format"           |
      | user@example.com   | short       | "Password must be 8+ characters" |
      | ""                 | Pass123!    | "Email is required"              |
      | user@example.com   | ""          | "Password is required"           |
```

### 3. Risk Assessment

Scores requirements based on complexity, dependencies, and potential impact on system stability.

**Risk Factors:**
- Technical complexity (integrations, algorithms, data transformations)
- External dependencies (third-party APIs, databases, services)
- Performance implications (scalability, latency, throughput)
- Security considerations (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

**Risk Matrix:**
```
Impact: Critical | High Priority Testing | Maximum Coverage | Disaster Recovery Plans
Impact: High     | Comprehensive Testing | Edge Case Focus  | Rollback Strategy
Impact: Medium   | Standard Testing      | Core Scenarios   | Monitor Closely
Impact: Low      | Basic Testing         | Happy Path       | Log Issues
                 Low        Medium       High        Critical
                        Complexity / Likelihood
```

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Validation

Ensures every requirement has clear, measurable acceptance criteria using the **SMART framework** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

**Validation Checklist:**
- ✅ Specific: Clearly defined success conditions
- ✅ Measurable: Quantifiable metrics (response time, error rate, uptime)
- ✅ Achievable: Technically feasible with available resources
- ✅ Relevant: Aligned with business goals and user needs
- ✅ Time-bound: Performance expectations and deadlines

**Example Validation:**
```yaml
requirement_id: AUTH-001
title: "User Login Feature"
original_criteria: "Users should be able to log in"
validation_status: INCOMPLETE

missing_elements:
  - specific: "What authentication method? (OAuth, email/password, SSO)"
  - measurable: "No success rate or performance metrics defined"
  - achievable: "Security requirements not specified"
  - time_bound: "No session timeout or token expiry defined"

enhanced_criteria:
  - "Users authenticate via email/password with bcrypt hashing"
  - "Login request completes within 200ms at p95"
  - "Success rate >99.5% excluding invalid credentials"
  - "JWT tokens expire after 24 hours"
  - "Failed login attempts locked after 5 tries for 15 minutes"
  - "MFA required for admin accounts"
  - "Session tokens rotated every 4 hours"
```

### 5. Traceability Mapping

Creates bidirectional traceability from business requirements through test cases to code implementation.

**Traceability Matrix:**
```
Business Requirement → Epic → User Story → Acceptance Criteria → BDD Scenario → Test Case → Code Module → Deployment

Example:
BR-123: Secure User Access
  ↓
EPIC-45: Authentication System
  ↓
US-234: User Login
  ↓
AC-001: Email/password authentication
  ↓
BDD-AUTH-001: Successful login scenario
  ↓
TEST-LOGIN-001: Integration test
  ↓
src/auth/login.service.ts
  ↓
Production v2.1.0
```

### 6. Edge Case Identification

Uses combinatorial testing and boundary value analysis to identify edge cases often missed in manual requirement analysis.

**Edge Case Categories:**
- Boundary values (min/max, empty/full, start/end)
- Null/undefined/missing data
- Concurrent operations and race conditions
- Network failures and timeouts
- Resource exhaustion (memory, disk, connections)
- Internationalization (UTF-8, timezones, locales)

**Example Edge Cases:**
```javascript
// Generated edge cases for "User Registration"
const edgeCases = [
  // Boundary values
  { email: "a@b.c", description: "Minimum valid email length" },
  { email: "x".repeat(254) + "@example.com", description: "Maximum email length (RFC 5321)" },
  { password: "Pass123!", description: "Minimum password complexity" },
  { password: "x".repeat(128), description: "Maximum password length" },

  // Special characters
  { email: "user+tag@example.com", description: "Email with plus sign" },
  { name: "O'Brien", description: "Name with apostrophe" },
  { name: "José María", description: "Name with accents" },
  { name: "李明", description: "Name with non-Latin characters" },

  // Concurrent operations
  { scenario: "Double submit prevention", description: "User clicks register twice" },
  { scenario: "Race condition", description: "Same email registered simultaneously" },

  // Error conditions
  { scenario: "Database connection lost", description: "Network failure during registration" },
  { scenario: "Email service timeout", description: "Verification email fails to send" },
  { scenario: "Disk full", description: "Cannot write user record" }
];
```

### 7. Requirement Completeness Check

Validates that requirements cover all necessary aspects using the **5 Ws framework** (Who, What, When, Where, Why).

**Completeness Checklist:**
- **Who**: All user roles and actors identified?
- **What**: All features and functionalities described?
- **When**: Timing, triggers, and scheduling defined?
- **Where**: Deployment environments and contexts specified?
- **Why**: Business value and user needs articulated?
- **How**: Technical approach and constraints documented?

## Coordination Protocol

This agent uses **AQE hooks (Agentic QE native hooks)** for coordination (zero external dependencies).

**Automatic Lifecycle Hooks:**
- `onPreTask()` - Called before task execution
- `onPostTask()` - Called after task completion
- `onTaskError()` - Called on task failure

**Memory Integration:**
```typescript
// Store validation results
await this.memoryStore.store('aqe/requirements/validation-report', validationResults, {
  partition: 'validation',
  ttl: 86400 // 24 hours
});

// Retrieve validated requirements
const validated = await this.memoryStore.retrieve('aqe/requirements/validated', {
  partition: 'requirements'
});

// Store BDD scenarios
await this.memoryStore.store('aqe/bdd-scenarios/generated', bddScenarios, {
  partition: 'scenarios'
});
```

**Event Bus Integration:**
```typescript
// Emit events for coordination
this.eventBus.emit('requirements-validator:completed', {
  agentId: this.agentId,
  requirementsValidated: count,
  scenariosGenerated: scenarioCount
});

// Listen for fleet events
this.registerEventHandler({
  eventType: 'requirements:validation-requested',
  handler: async (event) => {
    await this.validateRequirements(event.requirements);
  }
});
```

Feature: User API Contract Validation

  Scenario: GET /api/users/:id returns valid user schema
    Given a valid user ID "usr_12345"
    When a GET request is made to "/api/users/usr_12345"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response body matches the User schema
    And the response includes required fields: id, email, created_at
    And the response time is under 100ms
    And the Content-Type header is "application/json"

  Scenario: POST /api/users validates required fields
    Given a POST request to "/api/users"
    And the request body is missing "email" field
    When the request is submitted
    Then the response status is 400
    And the error message includes "email is required"
    And no user record is created
```

### Use Case 3: Legacy Feature Documentation

**Scenario**: Undocumented legacy feature needs test coverage.

**Workflow:**
```bash

Feature: GDPR Compliance - Right to Erasure

  Scenario: User requests complete data deletion
    Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
    And the user has 50 historical records across 8 tables
    When the user submits a "Right to Erasure" request
    Then all personal data is anonymized within 30 days
    And user profile, orders, and logs are deleted
    And audit log records the deletion with timestamp
    And confirmation email is sent to the user
    And backup systems purge data within 90 days
    And third-party integrations are notified

  Scenario: Data deletion request validation
    Given a data deletion request
