All skills reflect these values:

- **Practice over theory** - Based on 12+ years in production, not just study
- **Value over compliance** - Focus on customer value, not process adherence
- **Pragmatism over purity** - Blend approaches as needed for your context
- **Quality built-in** - Prevention over detection, shift-left thinking
