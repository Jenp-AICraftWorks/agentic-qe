# Extreme Programming (XP) Practices

## Core Philosophy

XP emphasizes technical excellence, rapid feedback, and sustainable pace. It's about doing the simple thing that could possibly work, then iterating based on real feedback.

## The Five Values

1. **Communication** - Everyone knows what everyone else is doing
2. **Simplicity** - Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
3. **Feedback** - Get feedback early and often
4. **Courage** - Tell the truth about progress and estimates, adapt when needed
5. **Respect** - Everyone contributes value, treat team members well

## Core XP Practices

### 1. Pair Programming

**Definition:** Two developers working together at one workstation. One writes code (driver), the other reviews each line as it's typed (navigator).

#### Pairing Styles

**Driver-Navigator (Classic)**
- Driver: Writes code
- Navigator: Reviews, suggests, thinks ahead
- Rotate every 20-30 minutes

**Ping-Pong Pairing (with TDD)**
```
Person A: Writes failing test
Person B: Makes test pass
Person B: Refactors
Person B: Writes next failing test
Person A: Makes test pass
[Continue...]
```

**Strong-Style Pairing**
- "For an idea to go from your head to the computer, it must go through someone else's hands"
- Great for mentoring/knowledge transfer

#### When to Pair

**ALWAYS pair for:**
- Complex or risky code
- Learning new technology
- Onboarding new team members
- Critical bug fixes
- Architectural decisions

**CAN pair for:**
- Regular feature development
- Refactoring sessions
- Code reviews (live pairing review)

**DON'T pair for:**
- Simple, well-understood tasks
- Spikes/research (pair to discuss findings)
- Personal learning time
- Admin work

#### Making Pairing Work

**Do:**
- ✅ Switch roles regularly (20-30 min)
- ✅ Take breaks together
- ✅ Speak your thoughts aloud
- ✅ Ask questions
- ✅ Challenge ideas respectfully
- ✅ Keep sessions 2-4 hours max

**Don't:**
- ❌ Grab keyboard without asking
- ❌ Check phone/email while pairing
- ❌ Dominate the conversation
- ❌ Pair all day every day (exhausting)
- ❌ Pair with same person exclusively

#### Remote Pairing Tools

- **VS Code Live Share** - Shared editing, debugging
- **Tuple** - Low-latency screen sharing for pairing
- **Zoom/Meet** - Standard video with screen share
- **tmux/screen** - Terminal sharing for CLI work

### 2. Ensemble Programming (Mob Programming)

**Definition:** 3+ developers working together on the same code at the same workstation.

#### Ensemble Setup

```
[Projector/Large Screen]
        ↓
[Computer with Code]
        ↓
    [Driver]
      ← ← ←
[Navigator 1] [Navigator 2] [Navigator 3]
```

**Rotation:** Driver switches every 5-10 minutes

#### Ensemble Patterns

**Strong-Style Mob**
- Navigators direct, driver types
- Driver doesn't add own ideas while driving
- Forces clear communication

**Rotating Facilitator**
- One person manages time/rotation
- Keeps discussion focused
- Rotates like driver position

**Expert Learning**
- Expert explains while driving
- Others learn and ask questions
- Useful for knowledge transfer

#### When to Ensemble

**Great for:**
- Complex problem solving
- Architectural decisions  
- Learning new frameworks
- Kickstarting difficult features
- Resolving blockers

**Not great for:**
- Simple, well-understood tasks
- When people need deep focus
- Long-term (unsustainable)

### 3. Continuous Integration

**Definition:** Integrate code into shared repository frequently (multiple times per day), with automated build and tests.

#### CI Workflow

```
Developer:
1. Pull latest from main
2. Make small change (<2 hours work)
3. Run tests locally (all pass)
4. Commit and push to main
5. CI runs tests automatically
6. If tests fail → fix immediately

Pipeline:
main ← commit
  ↓
[Run Tests]
  ↓
[Build]
  ↓
[Deploy to Staging]
```

#### CI Best Practices

**Commit frequently:**
- Small commits (< 2 hours of work)
- Each commit should pass all tests
- Commit to main/trunk (no long-lived branches)

**Keep build fast:**
- Full build + tests < 10 minutes
- Faster feedback = more valuable
- Parallelize slow tests

**Fix broken builds immediately:**
- Broken build = top priority
- Don't commit more code until fixed
- Revert commit if fix takes too long

**Automate everything:**
- Tests run automatically
- Build happens automatically
- Deploy to staging automatically

### 4. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

(See `tdd-london-chicago` skill for deep dive)

**Red-Green-Refactor cycle:**
1. Write failing test (Red)
2. Write minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

**XP emphasis:** Tests as executable specifications, safety net for refactoring.

### 5. Simple Design

**Four Rules of Simple Design** (Kent Beck):
1. Passes all tests
2. Reveals intention (clear, expressive)
3. No duplication (DRY principle)
4. Fewest elements (no speculative code)

**Apply in order - tests first!**

#### Examples

**Not simple:**
```javascript
// Speculative generalization
class PaymentProcessor {
  process(payment, options = {}) {
    // Supports 15 payment types we might need someday
    // Has configuration for every possible scenario
    // 500 lines of "just in case" code
  }
}
```

**Simple:**
```javascript
// Just what we need today
class PaymentProcessor {
  processCreditCard(cardInfo) {
    // Does one thing well
    // 30 lines of clear code
  }
}

// Add complexity only when needed
```

### 6. Refactoring

**Definition:** Improving code structure without changing behavior.

#### When to Refactor

**The Rule of Three:**
1. First time: Just do it
2. Second time: Wince and duplicate
3. Third time: Refactor

**Refactor when:**
- Tests are green
- You see duplication
- Code is hard to understand
- Adding feature reveals poor design
- During green phase of TDD

**Don't refactor when:**
- Tests are failing
- Under deadline pressure (address later)
- Code works and rarely changes

#### Safe Refactoring

**Always:**
1. Have tests that pass
2. Refactor in small steps
3. Run tests after each step
4. Commit working code frequently

**Common Refactorings:**
- Extract method
- Rename for clarity
- Remove duplication
- Introduce parameter object
- Replace conditional with polymorphism

### 7. Collective Code Ownership

**Principle:** Anyone can improve any part of the codebase.

**Benefits:**
- No bottlenecks (no waiting for "that one person")
- Knowledge spreads across team
- Code quality improves (more eyes)
- Bus factor > 1

**Requirements:**
- Comprehensive test suite (safety net)
- Coding standards (consistency)
- Continuous integration (catch issues fast)
- Code reviews or pairing (maintain quality)

**In practice:**
```
❌ "That's Alice's module, only she can change it"
✅ "I see an issue in this module, I'll pair with Alice to fix it"
✅ "I need to change this module, I'll write tests first"
```

### 8. Coding Standards

**Purpose:** Consistency makes collaboration easier.

**What to standardize:**
- Formatting (use auto-formatter: Prettier, Black)
- Naming conventions
- File structure
- Testing patterns
- Documentation style

**How to maintain:**
- Automated linting (ESLint, Pylint)
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI enforcement
- Pair/ensemble programming (natural alignment)

**Don't:**
- Have 50-page style guides no one reads
- Enforce arbitrary preferences
- Spend hours debating tabs vs spaces (use formatter)

### 9. Sustainable Pace

**Principle:** Team should work at a pace they can sustain indefinitely.

**40-hour work week:**
- No routine overtime
- Regular hours = sustainable productivity
- Tired developers write bugs

**Warning signs of unsustainable pace:**
- Regular late nights/weekends
- Increasing bug rate
- Declining code quality
- Team burnout/turnover
- Decreased morale

**How to maintain:**
- Realistic estimates
- Buffer time in plans
- Say no to unrealistic deadlines
- Measure velocity, plan accordingly
- Take vacations

### 10. Small Releases

**Principle:** Release working software frequently.

**Benefits:**
- Fast feedback from users
- Reduced risk (small changes)
- Easier to debug (what changed?)
- Business value delivered sooner

**How small?**
- Deploy to production: daily or weekly
- Internal release: multiple times per day
- Feature flags for incomplete work

**Continuous Deployment:**
```
Commit → CI Tests → Deploy Staging → Automated Tests → Deploy Production
[All automated, happens multiple times per day]
```

### 11. On-Site Customer

**Modern interpretation:** Product Owner embedded with team.

**Customer responsibilities:**
- Writes user stories
- Prioritizes backlog
- Answers questions immediately  
- Accepts completed work
- Makes scope decisions

**Not realistic:** Customer physically present 40hrs/week

**Practical compromise:**
- Daily standup attendance
- Available for questions (Slack/quick calls)
- Sprint planning and review
- Regular demo sessions

### 12. Metaphor / Ubiquitous Language

**Principle:** Shared vocabulary between technical and non-technical team members.

**Example - E-commerce System:**
```
Shared language:
- "Cart" (not "session shopping container")
- "Checkout" (not "payment initialization workflow")
- "Order" (not "purchase transaction record")

Everyone uses same terms:
- Product owner writes stories using these words
- Developers name classes/methods using these words
- Tests use these words
- Documentation uses these words
```

**Benefits:**
- Clearer communication
- Code reflects business domain
- Less translation needed
- Easier onboarding

## Combining XP Practices

### Practice Synergies

**TDD + Pair Programming**
```
Ping-pong pairing with TDD:
Person A writes test → Person B makes it pass
High quality code, fast feedback, knowledge sharing
```

**Collective Ownership + CI + Tests**
```
Anyone can change anything because:
- Tests catch regressions immediately
- CI runs tests on every commit  
- Broken builds fixed immediately
No fear of stepping on toes
```

**Simple Design + Refactoring**
```
Start with simplest design
When requirements change → refactor
Tests give confidence to refactor
Never build more than needed
```

## Adapting XP for Your Context

### Startup Context
- **Keep:** TDD, CI, Simple Design, Small Releases
- **Adapt:** Pair occasionally (not always), lighter standards
- **Skip:** Might not need dedicated on-site customer

### Enterprise Context
- **Keep:** All practices, especially sustainable pace
- **Adapt:** More formal standards, documentation requirements
- **Add:** Architecture reviews, security scans

### Remote Team
- **Keep:** All core practices  
- **Adapt:** Remote pairing tools, async communication
- **Add:** Over-communicate, document decisions

### Legacy Codebase
- **Start with:** Tests for changes, CI, Refactoring
- **Build towards:** TDD for new code, Collective ownership
- **Be patient:** Can't adopt everything at once

## Common Objections (and Responses)

**"Pair programming is twice as slow"**
→ Studies show 15% slower to write, 15% fewer bugs, better design. Net positive.

**"We don't have time for TDD"**
→ You don't have time NOT to. Debugging takes longer than writing tests.

**"Continuous integration is too hard to set up"**
→ Start simple: GitHub Actions with one test. Build from there.

**"Collective ownership will create chaos"**
→ Only with poor tests and no CI. Fix those first.

**"40-hour weeks won't work for our deadlines"**
→ Your deadlines are based on unsustainable pace. Adjust estimates.

## XP in Quality Engineering

### QE-Specific Applications

**Ensemble Testing Sessions**
- 3-5 people exploring together
- Share testing heuristics in real-time
- Rapid bug discovery and investigation

**Test Code Pairing**
- Pair on test automation
- Share testing patterns
- Improve test quality

**Quality as Team Responsibility**
- Developers write tests
- QE does exploratory testing
- Everyone owns quality

**Continuous Testing**
- Tests run on every commit
- Fast feedback on quality
- No separate QE phase

## Measuring XP Success

**Code Quality Metrics:**
- Test coverage trend
- Defect density
- Code churn

**Team Health Metrics:**
- Velocity consistency
- Team satisfaction surveys
- Turnover rate

**Delivery Metrics:**
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery

**Don't measure:**
- Lines of code written
- Hours worked
- Number of commits

## Remember

XP practices work together as a system. Don't cherry-pick randomly:
- Start with practices that give immediate value
- Build supporting practices gradually
- Adapt to your context
- Measure results

**The goal:** Sustainable delivery of high-quality software through technical excellence and teamwork.
