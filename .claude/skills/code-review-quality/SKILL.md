# Code Review Quality

## Core Philosophy

Code review is about learning, teaching, and improving quality - not gatekeeping or showing off. Be constructive, be specific, be kind.

**Key principle:** Review code like you're helping a colleague, not judging them.

## The Code Review Mindset

### What You're Looking For

**Must address:**
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Breaking changes

**Should address:**
- Unclear naming
- Missing tests
- Duplicated code
- Complex logic

**Nice to have:**
- Style inconsistencies (if not auto-fixable)
- Minor optimizations
- Suggestions for improvement

**Not your job:**
- Enforcing personal preferences
- Rewriting in your style
- Nitpicking formatting (use linter)

### Questions to Ask Yourself

**Is this a problem or a preference?**
- Problem: Will cause bugs, confuse future maintainers
- Preference: "I would have done it differently"

**Is this blocking or non-blocking?**
- Blocking: Must fix before merge
- Non-blocking: Suggestion for future improvement

**Am I teaching or judging?**
- Teaching: "Here's why this could be better"
- Judging: "This is wrong"

## Feedback Levels

Use these prefixes to indicate severity:

**üî¥ BLOCKER** - Must fix before merging
```
üî¥ This function has SQL injection vulnerability.
Use parameterized queries instead.
```

**üü° MAJOR** - Should fix, but not necessarily blocking
```
üü° This test doesn't actually verify the error handling.
Consider adding assertion for error message.
```

**üü¢ MINOR** - Nice to have, optional
```
üü¢ Consider extracting this into a separate function
for better readability (optional).
```

**üí° SUGGESTION** - Ideas for improvement
```
üí° For future consideration: We could cache this
result to improve performance.
```

## The Review Process

### 1. Understand the Context

**Before reviewing code, check:**
- PR description - What problem does this solve?
- Linked issues/tickets - Why is this needed?
- Related PRs - Is this part of larger change?

**Bad start:** Jump straight to code and criticize
**Good start:** Understand what they're trying to accomplish

### 2. Review at Different Levels

**High-level (5 min):**
- Does approach make sense?
- Are there architectural concerns?
- Does it fit with existing patterns?

**Detail-level (15-30 min):**
- Logic correctness
- Edge cases handled?
- Error handling adequate?
- Tests sufficient?

**Micro-level (5 min):**
- Naming clear?
- Code readable?
- Comments where needed?

### 3. Look for Common Issues

**Logic Errors**
```javascript
// üî¥ BLOCKER: Logic error
if (price > 100 && price < 50) { // Impossible condition
  applyDiscount();
}

// Should be:
if (price > 100 || (price >= 50 && price <= 100)) {
  applyDiscount();
}
```

**Null/Undefined Handling**
```javascript
// üü° MAJOR: Possible null reference
function calculateTotal(order) {
  return order.items.reduce(...); // What if order.items is null?
}

// Suggestion:
function calculateTotal(order) {
  if (!order?.items?.length) return 0;
  return order.items.reduce(...);
}
```

**Race Conditions**
```javascript
// üî¥ BLOCKER: Race condition
async function updateInventory(productId, quantity) {
  const product = await db.products.findById(productId);
  product.stock -= quantity; // Not atomic!
  await product.save();
}

// Suggestion:
async function updateInventory(productId, quantity) {
  await db.products.updateOne(
    { _id: productId, stock: { $gte: quantity } },
    { $inc: { stock: -quantity } }
  );
}
```

**Missing Tests**
```javascript
// üü° MAJOR: Missing test coverage
function calculateDiscount(price, customerType) {
  // Complex business logic
  // ...
}

// No tests provided. Should test:
// - Different customer types
// - Edge cases (price = 0, negative)
// - Boundary values
```

**Security Issues**
```javascript
// üî¥ BLOCKER: SQL injection vulnerability
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;

// Use parameterized query:
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?';
db.query(query, [email]);
```

## Writing Good Review Comments

### Be Specific

**Bad:**
```
This function is too long.
```

**Good:**
```
üü° This function has 4 distinct responsibilities:
1. Validation
2. Calculation  
3. Database save
4. Email sending

Consider extracting into separate functions for easier testing:
- validateOrder()
- calculateTotal()
- saveOrder()
- sendConfirmation()
```

### Explain Why

**Bad:**
```
Don't use var.
```

**Good:**
```
üü¢ Consider using `const` or `let` instead of `var`.
`var` has function scope which can lead to unexpected 
behavior with closures. `const`/`let` have block scope
which is more predictable.
```

### Suggest Solutions

**Bad:**
```
This won't work.
```

**Good:**
```
üî¥ This will fail when items array is empty.

Suggested fix:
if (!items || items.length === 0) {
  return 0;
}
```

### Ask Questions

**Accusatory:**
```
Why did you do it this way?
```

**Curious:**
```
üí° I'm curious about the approach here. Have you
considered using X pattern? It might simplify
the error handling. What do you think?
```

### Praise Good Work

**Don't just criticize, also highlight good things:**
```
‚úÖ Nice use of early returns to avoid nested conditionals.
This is much more readable than the previous version!
```

```
‚úÖ Great test coverage on the edge cases. The negative
price test is especially important.
```

## The Comment Template

```markdown
üî¥/üü°/üü¢/üí° [Brief description of issue]

**Current code:**
```[language]
[code snippet]
```

**Issue:**
[Explain what's wrong and why it matters]

**Suggested fix:**
```[language]
[code snippet with solution]
```

**Alternative:**
[If applicable, mention other approaches]
```

### Example Using Template

```markdown
üî¥ SQL injection vulnerability in user search

**Current code:**
```javascript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%${searchTerm}%'`;
const results = await db.query(query);
```

**Issue:**
User input is directly interpolated into SQL query. An attacker
could inject SQL code (e.g., searchTerm = "'; DROP TABLE users--")

**Suggested fix:**
```javascript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?';
const results = await db.query(query, [`%${searchTerm}%`]);
```

**Alternative:**
If using an ORM:
```javascript
const results = await User.findAll({
  where: {
    name: { [Op.like]: `%${searchTerm}%` }
  }
});
```
```

## What NOT to Review

### Don't Review (Automate Instead)

**Formatting**
- Indentation, spacing, line breaks
- **Solution:** Use Prettier, ESLint with auto-fix

**Code Style**
- Semicolons, quotes, naming conventions
- **Solution:** ESLint, style guide enforced in CI

**Import Order**
- Which imports come first
- **Solution:** ESLint plugin for imports

**Type Errors**
- TypeScript compile errors
- **Solution:** TypeScript in CI

## Handling Disagreements

### When Author Disagrees with Your Feedback

**Your comment:**
```
üü° Consider extracting this into a separate function.
```

**Their response:**
```
I don't think that's necessary. The function is fine as is.
```

**Your options:**

**If non-blocking (üü¢üí°):**
```
Fair enough! It's a stylistic preference. Feel free to leave as is.
```

**If important (üü°):**
```
I understand your perspective. My concern is that this
function currently handles 4 different responsibilities,
which makes it harder to test in isolation. Would you be
open to extracting just the calculation logic?
```

**If critical (üî¥):**
```
I appreciate you're trying to keep it simple, but this
is a security vulnerability. We need to fix this before
merging. Let's discuss the best approach - happy to pair
on it if helpful.
```

### When You're Wrong

**Happens to everyone. Be gracious:**
```
You're absolutely right - I missed that this is handled
in the middleware layer. Thanks for clarifying! 
Resolving this comment.
```

## Review Timing

### How Long Should Review Take?

**Small PR (<100 lines):** 10-15 minutes
**Medium PR (100-500 lines):** 30-45 minutes  
**Large PR (>500 lines):** 1-2 hours (or ask to split)

### When to Request Changes

**Immediately:** Critical bugs, security issues
**Within 4 hours:** Normal business hours, blocking work
**Within 24 hours:** Non-urgent, non-blocking

### When PR is Too Large

```
This PR is quite large (847 lines). Would you consider
splitting into smaller PRs? It's hard to review thoroughly
in one go, and increases risk of missing issues.

Suggested splits:
1. Database schema changes
2. API endpoints
3. Frontend components
4. Tests

Happy to prioritize reviewing the first chunk today!
```

## Example Reviews

### Excellent Review Comment

```markdown
üî¥ Memory leak in event handler

**Current code:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

**Issue:**
Event listener is registered but never cleaned up. On component
unmount, the listener remains active, causing a memory leak.
This will accumulate if component mounts/unmounts frequently.

**Suggested fix:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  };
}, []);
```

The return function acts as cleanup, removing the listener when
component unmounts.

```

### Poor Review Comment

```markdown
This is bad. Rewrite it.
```

**Problems:**
- Not specific
- No explanation
- No suggestion
- Unhelpful tone

## Reviewing Your Own Code

Before requesting review:

### Self-Review Checklist
- [ ] Read through entire diff
- [ ] Remove debug code, console.logs
- [ ] Check for commented-out code
- [ ] Verify tests pass locally
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Write clear PR description
- [ ] Add screenshots/videos if UI change
- [ ] Link related issues

### Pre-Review Your Own Comments

Add comments explaining:
- Non-obvious decisions
- Workarounds and why
- Areas you're unsure about
- Questions for reviewers

```javascript
// NOTE: Using setTimeout here instead of requestAnimationFrame
// because we need this to run after React's commit phase.
// Tried RAF but it caused flicker on initial render.
setTimeout(() => scrollToElement(ref.current), 0);
```

## Remember

**Good code review is:**
- Collaborative, not adversarial
- Teaching, not judging  
- Specific, not vague
- Constructive, not destructive
- Timely, not delayed

**The goal is better code and better developers, not perfect code.**

Review with empathy. Everyone writes imperfect code sometimes. Your job is to help make it better, not to prove how smart you are.
