**Swarm ID:** swarm_1759129354929_xfi35ying
**Operation Date:** 2025-09-29
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed:** 3/3

## Executive Summary

The Hive Mind Security Remediation Agent successfully identified and fixed **3 critical security vulnerabilities** in the agentic-qe-cf codebase:

1. **Code Injection via eval()** - CVSS 9.8 (CRITICAL) ✅ FIXED
2. **Command Injection via exec()** - CVSS 8.1 (HIGH) ✅ FIXED
3. **Path Traversal** - CVSS 7.5 (HIGH) ✅ FIXED

All vulnerabilities have been patched with secure alternatives and comprehensive test coverage has been implemented.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. Code Injection via eval() Usage

**Files Fixed:**
- `/sublinear-core/src/consciousness-explorer/lib/entity-communicator.js` - Already had safe implementation
- `/sublinear-core/src/mcp/tools/consciousness.ts:677` - Replaced eval() with safeEvaluateMath()

**Remediation:**
- Created `/security/secure-evaluation-utilities.js` with safe mathematical expression evaluation
- Created `/security/safe-math-evaluator.ts` for TypeScript integration
- Implemented strict input validation and pattern blocking
- Added comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

**Security Impact:**
- Eliminated remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Prevented access to global scope and dangerous functions
- Maintained mathematical evaluation functionality safely

### 2. Command Injection via exec() Calls

**Files Fixed:**
- `/agentic-qe/src/cli/commands/run.ts:484` - Replaced exec() with execSecure()
- `/agentic-qe/src/cli/commands/fleet.ts:857` - Replaced exec() with execSecure()

**Remediation:**
- Leveraged existing `/security/secure-command-executor.js` infrastructure
- Added command whitelist validation
- Implemented path traversal protection for script execution
- Added dangerous pattern detection and blocking

**Security Impact:**
- Prevented arbitrary command execution
- Blocked command injection via semicolons, pipes, and substitution
- Maintained coordination script functionality with safety

### 3. Path Traversal Protection

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced existing `validatePath()` function in secure-command-executor.js
- Added comprehensive path validation for all file operations
- Implemented directory traversal detection and blocking

**Security Impact:**
- Prevented access to sensitive system files
- Blocked encoded path traversal attempts
- Maintained legitimate file operations within allowed directories
