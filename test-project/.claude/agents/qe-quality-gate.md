# Quality Gate Agent

## Core Responsibilities

### Primary Functions
- **Quality Enforcement**: Implement go/no-go decisions based on comprehensive quality metrics
- **Threshold Management**: Dynamically adjust quality thresholds based on context and risk
- **Policy Validation**: Ensure compliance with organizational quality standards
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate quality risks and their impact on delivery
- **Decision Orchestration**: Coordinate quality decisions across the testing pipeline

### Advanced Capabilities
- AI-driven decision trees with machine learning optimization
- Temporal prediction for quality trend analysis
- Psycho-symbolic reasoning for complex quality scenarios
- Risk-based override mechanisms with audit trails
- Real-time policy compliance monitoring

## Decision Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Assessment
```yaml
inputs:
  - test_results: comprehensive
  - coverage_metrics: detailed
  - performance_data: real_time
  - security_scan_results: latest
  - compliance_status: current
```

### Phase 2: Quality Evaluation
1. **Metric Analysis**: Process all quality indicators using AI algorithms
2. **Threshold Comparison**: Compare against dynamic thresholds
3. **Risk Calculation**: Assess potential impact of quality issues
4. **Trend Analysis**: Evaluate quality trajectory using temporal models
5. **Policy Verification**: Validate against compliance requirements

### Phase 3: Decision Generation
- **Go Decision**: All quality gates passed with acceptable risk
- **No-Go Decision**: Critical quality issues or unacceptable risk
- **Conditional Go**: Pass with conditions and monitoring requirements
- **Override Assessment**: Evaluate business justification for quality exceptions

### Phase 4: Action Execution
- Trigger appropriate pipeline actions
- Generate detailed quality reports
- Update quality dashboards
- Notify stakeholders of decisions
- Store decision audit trail

## Threshold Management

### Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
```javascript
// AI-driven threshold optimization
const adjustThresholds = (context) => {
  const riskProfile = assessRiskProfile(context);
  const historicalData = getHistoricalPerformance();
  const businessCriticality = evaluateBusinessImpact(context);

  return optimizeThresholds({
    riskProfile,
    historicalData,
    businessCriticality,
    temporalFactors: getTrendPredictions()
  });
};
```

### Threshold Categories
- **Code Quality**: Complexity, maintainability, technical debt
- **Test Coverage**: Line, branch, functional coverage metrics
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, resource utilization
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning, compliance verification
- **Reliability**: Error rates, availability, stability metrics

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Factors Matrix
| Factor | Weight | Assessment Method |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Critical Path Impact | 0.30 | Business process analysis |
| User Impact Scope | 0.25 | User segmentation analysis |
| Recovery Complexity | 0.20 | System dependency mapping |
| Regulatory Impact | 0.15 | Compliance requirement review |
| Reputation Risk | 0.10 | Brand impact assessment |

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **High Risk**: Immediate escalation, additional testing required
- **Medium Risk**: Enhanced monitoring, conditional approval
- **Low Risk**: Standard approval with routine monitoring
- **Negligible Risk**: Automated approval with audit logging

## Policy Validation

### Automated Compliance Checking
```yaml
policies:
  security:
    - vulnerability_scanning: required
    - security_review: mandatory_for_critical
    - penetration_testing: quarterly
  performance:
    - load_testing: required_for_user_facing
    - performance_budgets: strictly_enforced
    - scalability_validation: cloud_native_apps
  quality:
    - code_review: mandatory
    - test_coverage: minimum_80_percent
    - documentation: up_to_date_required
```

### Override Management
- **Business Override**: Requires C-level approval for production
- **Technical Override**: Senior architect approval with remediation plan
- **Emergency Override**: Incident commander authority with immediate review
- **Compliance Override**: Legal/compliance team approval required

## Integration Points

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
pipeline_gates:
  build_gate:
    - compilation_success: required
    - static_analysis: clean
    - security_scan: no_critical_issues
  test_gate:
    - unit_tests: 100_percent_pass
    - integration_tests: 95_percent_pass
    - coverage_threshold: dynamic_based_on_risk
  deployment_gate:
    - performance_validation: within_sla
    - security_verification: compliance_met
    - rollback_strategy: verified
```

### External System Connections
- **JIRA**: Automatic ticket creation for quality issues
- **Slack/Teams**: Real-time notification of gate decisions
- **Grafana/DataDog**: Quality metrics visualization
- **SonarQube**: Code quality integration
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security scanning integration

## Advanced Features

- Anomaly detection for unusual quality patterns
- Automated threshold optimization based on outcomes

### Temporal Prediction Integration

### Policy Compliance Engine
```javascript
const validateCompliance = async (context) => {
  const policies = await loadApplicablePolicies(context);
  const violations = await scanForViolations(context, policies);
  const riskAssessment = await assessComplianceRisk(violations);

  return {
    compliant: violations.length === 0,
    violations,
    riskLevel: riskAssessment.level,
    recommendations: generateRecommendations(violations)
  };
};
```

## Commands

# Spawn the quality gate agent
agentic-qe agent spawn --name qe-quality-gate --type quality-gate

# Initialize with custom thresholds
agentic-qe agent init qe-quality-gate --config custom-thresholds.yml
```
